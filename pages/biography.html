        <p>
          Fay has always had an artistic instinct and at just 10 years old she was awarded first prize for her drawing by the Mayor of the City of Mulhouse. Intrigued by theatre Fay starts acting lessons but after entering The Fine Arts of Besançon, her father opposes it exclaiming “Acting is the job of a tramp!” Frustrated and still a minor, she studies her Baccalaureate and fails. Fay leaves for Paris and enrols in acting training at Cours Simon and Cours Florent. Despite appearances as a supernumerary and leading roles in a number of short films, Fay was continually offered only roles as a domestic helper or a prostitute. Not wishing to endorse unflattering contracts for the status of women, especially women of non white parentage Fay did not pursue her acting career.

            In 2003 faced with a pile of newspapers whilst looking for work, Fay starts to experiment with papier-mâche, remembering her lessons as a child. She begins to develop her work as an autodidact, this artistic expression quickly becomes a necessity. She exhibits some sculptures in an Amartiste Gallery in Courseulles and is convinced by the owner to persist in her artistic research.
            In 2005 Fay exhibits in another gallery where her work is noticed by Christine Debeurme a member of the Grand-Palais Selection Jury. Fayrouz’s work becomes more precise, refined and several more exhibitions follow.

          Fay’s work is permeated with humour and poetry, giving a delicious depth to each of her creations. “I like to tear paper, because only children tear”. This noise is like a lullaby for her. In addition to paper, she collects objects that people have abandoned over time and
          where obsolescence reigns: old jewellery, feathers, old flyers, road maps, comics. She repurposes them to integrate them into her sculptures or paintings. Each unique piece of artwork is created using hundreds of torn pieces of paper which she tames using glue and intricate folds, sculpting her trademark
          idiosyncratic creations.
